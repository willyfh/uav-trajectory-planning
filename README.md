# uav-trajectory-planning
The first unofficial implementation of a paper with the titled "UAV Trajectory Planning for Data Collection from Time-Constrained IoT Devices". In this repository, I implemented a sub-optimal algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) as introduced by Samir et al. (2019). Specifically, I reproduced the Figure 3 in the paper.
